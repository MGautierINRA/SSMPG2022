Simulated data -- Cl√©ment Gain

Individuals were sampled from 100 populations in an isolation-by-distance model in a square habitat. Simulations of a polygenic trait under selection including environmental conditions and local competitors were performed in SLIM 3. The fitness of all organisms was recorded. 

Four environmental variables involved in the process of local adaptation were measured at each sampled location, described by latitude and longitude. 

The fitness of a population at a particular geographic location is defined as the probability of survival of organisms in the current (and future) habitat. 

The genotypes.lfmm data file contains 300  individual samples genotyped at 2333 diploid loci. The format is an n x L matrix, with n = 300 and L = 2333, with individual samples in rows and genetic loci in columns. No missing data.

The metadata.csv file contains meta data for the 300 individuals

"id": individual ids

"pop": population label. Each population contains 1 to 8 individuals.

"longitude" and "latitude" are the spatial coordinates of the sample sites

"bio.1" "bio.2" "bio.3" "bio.4" are environnemental variables measured in the current habitat

"pred.bio.1" "pred.bio.2" "pred.bio.3" "pred.bio.4" are the same variables measured after environnemental 
change
