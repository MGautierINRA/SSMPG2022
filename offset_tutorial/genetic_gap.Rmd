In this notebook we're going to generate offset for each populations using method
genetic gap and package LEA.


```{r}
library(LEA)
```

First we load the data

```{r}
Y <- read.table("./genome")
X <- read.table("./variable_current")
Xpred <- read.table("./variable_pred")
pop <- read.table("./pop")[,1]
```


```{r}
gg.obj <- genetic.gap(Y, X,new.env = X, pred.env = Xpred, K=1)
```

We obtain a vector with one value for each individual.
In this specific case, within a population, all individuals has the same offset 
because of the way we simulate the data.

In a more realistic case, you can obtain a value for each population by obtaining the average value of offset for each individual of your population
```{r}
plot(gg.obj$distance, gg.obj$offset, xlab="environmental distance", ylab="genetic gap")
```
